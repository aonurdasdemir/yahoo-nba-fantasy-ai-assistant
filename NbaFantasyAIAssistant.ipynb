            "\n",
            "**1. Weakest Players:**\n",
            "\n",
            "The data shows incomplete stats for the last 10 days, making a definitive assessment challenging. However, based on the available data, here's a ranking of players by recent performance (considering only games with available data):\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Luke Kennard:** While he shows some decent assist numbers, his scoring is inconsistent and low.  His recent games have been a mix of decent output and very low.\n",
            "* **De'Aaron Fox:**  Shows inconsistency in scoring and high turnover numbers.  His FG% is also worrisome in the games played.\n",
            "* **Chris Paul:**  Similar to Fox; inconsistent scoring, but the assists are a strength. However, his scoring is lacking and the turnovers are an issue.\n",
            "* **Julian Champagnie:** Shows inconsistent performance but has high upside in some games, particularly in 3-pointers and blocks.  The inconsistency is problematic though.\n",
            "* **Tobias Harris:**  Generally consistent, with good scoring and rebounding, but hasn't always performed to expectations. His FT% is also a concern.\n",
            "* **Trey Murphy III:**  Shows promising scoring and assists but inconsistent and high number of turnovers.\n",
            "* **Mason Plumlee:**  Consistent rebounder, but his scoring is quite low.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**2. Suggested Free Agent Adds:**\n",
            "\n",
            "To address the weaknesses, I suggest focusing on consistent scoring and reducing turnovers.  Here are 5 free agents to consider, prioritizing scoring consistency and all-around contributions:\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Goga Bitadze:** He provides a needed boost in rebounds and blocks. While not a high scorer, he is more consistent than your current center.\n",
            "2. **Cason Wallace:** His assist and steal numbers are good, filling the gaps in your team's consistency.\n",
            "3. **Kris Dunn:**  Offers solid assists and steals, along with surprisingly good rebounding numbers. High potential for steals and assists.\n",
            "4. **Kentavious Caldwell-Pope:**  A decent option if you need a consistent mid-range scorer and solid defender.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**3. Add/Drop Recommendations:**\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Add:** Goga Bitadze and Kris Dunn.  Bitadze addresses your center position and improves rebounding and blocks. Dunn brings in much-needed steals and assists, which are currently lacking in your team.\n",
            "* **Drop:** Luke Kennard.  His recent performance is too inconsistent, and his scoring is not filling a vital role.  Although he has shown high assist numbers in some games, there are many other options for that category available.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Reasoning:**\n",
            "\n",
            "The combination of Bitadze and Dunn provides the necessary improvement in rebounding, assists, steals, and blocks, mitigating the weaknesses highlighted in the team analysis.  Dropping Kennard is the more reasonable decision as he is providing inconsistent scoring, and you can find much better steals and assists options in the free agent pool.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**Important Considerations:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Injury Reports:** Always check for injury updates before making any roster moves.  The provided data might not reflect the true potential of a player due to injury or resting.\n",
            "* **Upcoming Schedule:**  Consider the upcoming schedule of your players and free agents.  Look for players with favorable matchups.\n",
            "* **Positional Needs:**  While the above recommendations focus on overall statistical balance, ensure you maintain a well-rounded lineup of positions.\n",
